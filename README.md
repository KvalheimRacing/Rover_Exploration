# Search and Sample Return Project
![alt text][image_0] 

This project is modeled after the [NASA sample return challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html)  This project covers three essential elements of robotics, which are perception, decision making and actuation.  In this project, I have used a simulator environment built with the Unity game engine.  

## The Simulator
The simulator used can be downloaded here;  
* [For Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Rover+Unity+Sims/Linux_Roversim.zip) 
* [For Mac](	https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Rover+Unity+Sims/Mac_Roversim.zip)
* [For Windows](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Rover+Unity+Sims/Windows_Roversim.zip)  

>You can test out the simulator by opening it up and choosing "Training Mode".  Use the mouse or keyboard to navigate around the environment.

## Dependencies
You'll need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks installed
Here is a great link for learning more about [Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111)

## Recording Data
launch the simulator and choose "Training Mode" then hit "r".  Navigate to the directory you want to store data in, select it, and then drive around collecting data.  Hit "r" again to stop data collection.
